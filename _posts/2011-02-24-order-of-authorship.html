Order of authorship

The first author is primarily responsible for collecting and analyzing data, and writing
The last one, an established investigator, assumes the overall responsibility for the study
The middle authors are listed according to their order of importance to the study.

Another more strict definition of authorship is as follows:

Authorship credit should be based on
substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data;
drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content;
final approval of the version to be published.

Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3. Those who have participated in certain substantive aspects of the research project should be acknowledged or listed as contributors. Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research group, alone, does not justify authorship.

Each author should have sufficiently participated in the work to take public responsibilities for appropriate portions of the content. The corresponding author should ensure that all appropriate co-authors and no inappropriate co-authors are included on the paper. If there is plagiarism or other ethical problems, the corresponding author cannot hide behind or remain innocent.
