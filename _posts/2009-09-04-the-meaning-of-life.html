&gt;INTRODUCTION<br>The Talmud teaches:<br>Just before a baby is born,<br>     an angel shows it everything there is to know<br>     and learn<br>     on Earth.<br>Then at the moment of birth,<br>     the angel touches the infant&#039;s upper lip,<br>     and the child forgets everything.<br>We spend the rest of our lives<br>     remembering<br>     what the angel showed us.<br>This is a generic guide<br>     to the meaning of life.<br>It does not describe one view<br>     of the meaning of life<br>     and recommend you adopt it.<br>It helps you remember<br>     what the angel showed you.<br>The angel showed you<br>     the meaning of life.<br>In case you have not remembered yet,<br>     here is what the angel showed you.
