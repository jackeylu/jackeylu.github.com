Not a useful script, but a little fun never the less. <img src="http://jackeylu.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/1db2b23019c7e0c39bcc8d078f71e84d.gif" alt="" title="1db2b23019c7e0c39bcc8d078f71e84d" width="15" height="15" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-267" />

this is a few examples of usage for the SAPI.SpVoice Object (<em>microsoft sam</em>)

How to Make Your PC talk. (Talk Box Basic)

<pre>
</pre> <pre>
</pre> <pre> '************************
'* X BiLe
'* Local Talk Box
'* Solo VBS
'************************

do

'create the voice object
Set VObj = CreateObject(&quot;SAPI.SpVoice&quot;)

'get what the user wants to say, exit if cancel or return no msg
MSG = InputBox(&quot;Type what you want the PC to say&quot; &amp; VBCRLF &amp; VBCRLF &amp; VBCRLF &amp; &quot;To End enter Nothing or push the Cancel button&quot;, &quot;Voice Box By X BiLe&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
If MSG = &quot;&quot; Then WScript.quit: Else

'use the VObj to speak msg
with VObj
.Volume = 100
.Speak MSG
end with

loop
</pre>

Now the question is further posed on how to actually get someone elses pc to talk using remote access.

this challenge can easily be tackled assuming you have C$ access (C Share)

<em>Please also note that this is not the only way to do this like all things in computers, please remember that in all scripts you do <img src="http://jackeylu.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/629b0784d82f60798aecdc4896c15a31.gif" alt="" title="629b0784d82f60798aecdc4896c15a31" width="15" height="16" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-265" /></em>

<pre> '************************
'* X BiLe
'* Remote Voice Send
'* Solo VBS
'************************

'get ip
IP = InputBox(&quot;Type the Name or IP of the PC to send Voice to:&quot;, &quot;Remote Voice Send By X BiLe&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
If IP = &quot;&quot; Then WScript.quit: Else

'get MSG
MSG = InputBox(&quot;Type what you want the PC to say:&quot;, &quot;Remote Voice Send By X BiLe&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
If MSG = &quot;&quot; Then WScript.quit: Else

'vbs command to send
A = &quot;on error resume next&quot; &amp; VBCRLF &amp; _
&quot; CreateObject(&quot;&quot;SAPI.SpVoice&quot;&quot;).speak &quot; &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &amp; MSG &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &amp; VBCRLF &amp; _
&quot; CreateObject(&quot;&quot;Scripting.FileSystemObject&quot;&quot;).DeleteFile (&quot;&quot;C:Voice1.vbs&quot;&quot;)&quot;

' Create the vbs on remote C$
CreateObject(&quot;Scripting.FileSystemObject&quot;).OpenTextFile(&quot;\&quot; &amp; ip &amp; &quot;C$Voice1.vbs&quot;,2,True).Write A

' Run the VBS through Wscript on remote machine via WMI Object Win32_Process
B = GetObject(&quot;winmgmts:\&quot; &amp; IP &amp; &quot;rootcimv2:Win32_Process&quot;).Create(&quot;C:windowssystem32wscript.exe &quot;&quot;C:Voice1.vbs&quot;&quot;&quot;, null, null, intProcessID)

</pre>

like all objects to be created in VBS there are more than just the 3 properties i actually use here.

SAPI.SpVoice Properties:

'.Pause = pause speaking
'.resume = resume after pause
'.Rate = speed at which voice speaks
'.Voice = you can use set and a voice value to change the voice (if multiple exist on machine)
'.Volume = volume of voice (not system volume, just voice)
'.WaitUntilDone = wait until done - dont know how else to say that ;)

how to set the 3 useful voice Properties

<pre> 'create object and then setup the properties
Set VObj = CreateObject(&quot;SAPI.SpVoice&quot;)
with VObj
Set .voice = .getvoices.item(0)
.Volume = 100
.Rate = 3
end with
</pre>

Please notice that the '.getvoices.item(0)' has refrenced item 0, the getvoices is in an array (if multiple are present)

to retrive the names of the values you could do a simple call like:

<pre> 'create object and then loop for the index and name
Set VObj = CreateObject(&quot;SAPI.SpVoice&quot;)
For Each Voice In VObj.getvoices
I = I + 1
msgbox &quot;&quot; &amp; (I - 1) &amp; &quot; - &quot; &amp; Voice.GetDescription
Next
</pre>
i dont know, its just one of those toy codes any ways <img src="http://jackeylu.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/663bf6131b829ea9d9c3558cea01a15f.gif" alt="" title="663bf6131b829ea9d9c3558cea01a15f" width="15" height="15" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-266" />
