# What is cpplint.py?

## cpplint.py is a C++ linter provided by Google.

> Does google-lint on c++ files.
>
> The goal of this script is to identify places in the code that *may*
be in non-compliance with google style.  It does not attempt to fix
up these problems -- the point is to educate.  It does also not
attempt to find all problems, or to ensure that everything it does
find is legitimately a problem.
> 
> In particular, we can get very confused by /* and // inside strings!
We do a small hack, which is to ignore //'s with "'s after them on the
same line, but it is far from perfect (in either direction).

# Customizing cpplint

## Read the code of cpplint.py

> Talk is cheap, show me the code.

Everything is in the code, including the document.

## Goal
- Set the linelength as 120, instead of the deafult 80.
- exclude the violation for braces.


## We can implement it in
