&gt; At my day job, we sit behind a firewall which can break SSL certificates. If you attempt to install something with NPM and get the error message <em>npm ERR! Error: SSL Error: UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE</em>, it means you are in a similar situation. To fix this, simply run <strong>npm config set strict-ssl false</strong> and the issue will go away. Keep in mind that this makes your NPM installation less secure, and that you should re-enable strict-ssl whenever you are outside of the firewall.
