Reading report of `Real World Haskell`
======================================

[Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/) 
by Bryan O'Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen

# Why functional programming? Why Haskell? #

## Have we got a deal for you!##

1. Novelty, 
> Compared to the usual set of concepts in a programmer's mental toolbox,
> functional programming offers us a profoundly different way to think about software. 
>> In Haskell, we **de-emphasise code that modifies data. Instead, we focus on functions that take immutable values as input and produce new values as output.**
>> Given the samle imputs, these functions always return the same results. **This is the core idea behind functional programming.##


2. Power
3. Enjoyment

## What to expect from this book ##

With this book, we want to show you how to use functional programming and Haskell to solve realistic problems. This is a hands-on book: every chapter contains dozens of code samples, and many contain complete applications. Here are a few examples of the libraries, techniques and tools that we'll show you how to develop.

Reference material
*. [The Haskell Hierarchical Libraries](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/index.html) reference provides the documentation for the standard library that comes with your compiler. This is one of the most valuable online assets for Haskell programmers. 
*. For questions about language syntax and features, the [Haskell 98 Report](http://haskell.org/onlinereport/) describes the Haskell 98 language standard. 
*. Various extensions to the language have become commonplace since the Haskell 98 Report was released. [The GHC Users's Guide](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/index.html) contains detailed documentation on the extensions supported by GHC, as well as some GHC-specific features. 1 comment
*. [Hoogle](http://haskell.org/hoogle/) and [Hayoo](http://holumbus.fh-wedel.de/hayoo/hayoo.html) are Haskell API search engines. They can search for functions by name or by type.
