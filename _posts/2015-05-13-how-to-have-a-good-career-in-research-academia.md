See What Allen Newell and Prof. David A. Patterson said.

Allen Newell had a long and rich scientific career that contributed to
multiple subdisciplines in computer science. Still, each individual endeavor
was pursued with a characteristic style that his colleagues, students, and
friends recognized as essential to Allen.  The criteria by which a research
project is judged is predicated, foremost, on the belief that a good idea is
not enough. The qualities that transform a good idea into good science can be
captured in three maxims (attributable to Allen in spirit, if not in words):

Allen Newell拥有长期且丰富的科研工作经历，在计算机科学的众多分支中做出过贡献。

Good science responds to real phenomena (现象) or real problems.解决实际问题
    Good scientific problems are those that reflect real phenomena
    in the world or real problems that need to be solved. A candidate 
    project should include a clear statement of the real phenomena or 
    application it addresses.

Good science is in the details. 细节决定成败
    A scientific solution to a problem takes the form of a working 
    model that produces observable behavior or empirical data that
    can be compared and contrasted to the real phenomena. A candidate
    project should take the form of a detailed analysis or implemented 
    computational model and should include a clear statement of the 
    scope of its performance.

Good science makes a difference. 
    The measure of the contribution of a piece of work is in how it
    solves real problems or shapes the work of others. A candidate project 
    should include a clear statement of future work that is facilitated by 
    the research presented.
