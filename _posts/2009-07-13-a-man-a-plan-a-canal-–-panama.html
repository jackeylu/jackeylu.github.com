&gt;A Man, A Plan, A Canal – Panama!<br>In the first year after Fun-with-words.com was launched, over 200 of our<br>visitors sent this palindrome to us, so we&#039;ve given it a section of its<br>own! It is probably the best known palindrome ever:<p>A man, a plan, a canal – Panama!<p>It first appeared in 1948, but James Puder believes that it must have<br>been discovered before this. Read his Word Ways article: Who First Found<br>The Panama Palindrome? But it is not the only Panama palindrome; in fact<br>there is a whole family of them, some of them very long indeed. In 1983,<br>Jim Saxe added a cat to the list, creating:<p>A man, a plan, a cat, a canal – Panama!<p>A yak (a kind of ox) and a yam (a potato-like tuber) can be inserted,<br>lengthening it to:<p>A man, a plan, a cam, a yak, a yam, a canal – Panama!<p>Guy Jacobson found two more items that could be added to this extended<br>Panama palindrome, making the 17-word:<p>A man, a plan, a cat, a ham, a yak, a yam, a hat, a canal – Panama!<p>The following fantastic version was produced by Guy Steele in 1983. It<br>has 49 words.<p>A man, a plan, a canoe, pasta, heros, rajahs, a coloratura, maps, snipe,<br>percale, macaroni, a gag, a banana bag, a tan, a tag, a banana bag again<br>(or a camel), a crepe, pins, Spam, a rut, a Rolo, cash, a jar, sore<br>hats, a peon, a canal – Panama!<p>The following year Dan Hoey used a computer program and the Unix<br>spelling dictionary to generate a 540-word Panama palindrome. It doesn&#039;t<br>read so well as the others because the simple program allowed abstract<br>nouns and mass nouns like a ten, a salt and a wax.<p>A man, a plan, a caret, a ban, a myriad, a sum, a lac, a liar, a hoop, a<br>pint, a catalpa, a gas, an oil, a bird, a yell, a vat, a caw, a pax, a<br>wag, a tax, a nay, a ram, a cap, a yam, a gay, a tsar, a wall, a car, a<br>luger, a ward, a bin, a woman, a vassal, a wolf, a tuna, a nit, a pall,<br>a fret, a watt, a bay, a daub, a tan, a cab, a datum, a gall, a hat, a<br>fag, a zap, a say, a jaw, a lay, a wet, a gallop, a tug, a trot, a trap,<br>a tram, a torr, a caper, a top, a tonk, a toll, a ball, a fair, a sax, a<br>minim, a tenor, a bass, a passer, a capital, a rut, an amen, a ted, a<br>cabal, a tang, a sun, an ass, a maw, a sag, a jam, a dam, a sub, a salt,<br>an axon, a sail, an ad, a wadi, a radian, a room, a rood, a rip, a tad,<br>a pariah, a revel, a reel, a reed, a pool, a plug, a pin, a peek, a<br>parabola, a dog, a pat, a cud, a nu, a fan, a pal, a rum, a nod, an eta,<br>a lag, an eel, a batik, a mug, a mot, a nap, a maxim, a mood, a leek, a<br>grub, a gob, a gel, a drab, a citadel, a total, a cedar, a tap, a gag, a<br>rat, a manor, a bar, a gal, a cola, a pap, a yaw, a tab, a raj, a gab, a<br>nag, a pagan, a bag, a jar, a bat, a way, a papa, a local, a gar, a<br>baron, a mat, a rag, a gap, a tar, a decal, a tot, a led, a tic, a bard,<br>a leg, a bog, a burg, a keel, a doom, a mix, a map, an atom, a gum, a<br>kit, a baleen, a gala, a ten, a don, a mural, a pan, a faun, a ducat, a<br>pagoda, a lob, a rap, a keep, a nip, a gulp, a loop, a deer, a leer, a<br>lever, a hair, a pad, a tapir, a door, a moor, an aid, a raid, a wad, an<br>alias, an ox, an atlas, a bus, a madam, a jag, a saw, a mass, an anus, a<br>gnat, a lab, a cadet, an em, a natural, a tip, a caress, a pass, a<br>baronet, a minimax, a sari, a fall, a ballot, a knot, a pot, a rep, a<br>carrot, a mart, a part, a tort, a gut, a poll, a gateway, a law, a jay,<br>a sap, a zag, a fat, a hall, a gamut, a dab, a can, a tabu, a day, a<br>batt, a waterfall, a patina, a nut, a flow, a lass, a van, a mow, a nib,<br>a draw, a regular, a call, a war, a stay, a gam, a yap, a cam, a ray, an<br>ax, a tag, a wax, a paw, a cat, a valley, a drib, a lion, a saga, a<br>plat, a catnip, a pooh, a rail, a calamus, a dairyman, a bater, a canal<br>– Panama!<p>More Panama-Type Palindromes<br>Many palindromes similar to these Panama palindromes were discovered<br>years before A man, a plan, a canal – Panama was first published.<p>In 1899, the following appeared in The Ardmore Puzzler; it is by T. H.<br>Moscow.<p>A mar on a panorama!<p>Thirty years later, 1929, a wordsmith named Lubin came up with:<p>A dog, a panic in a pagoda!<p>And around 1970 James A. Lindon extended this to:<p>A dog, a pant, a panic in a Patna pagoda!<p>(Patna is a city of northeast India on the Ganges River.) Another<br>variation of the pagoda palindrome, and the most similar to the famous<br>Panama palindrome, is:<p>A dog, a plan, a canal: pagoda!<p>More recently, Edward Wolpow put his twist on it with:<p>A man appals; I slap Panama!<p>George Bush&#039;s invasion of that country in 1989 inspired:<p>A man, a pain, a mania, Panama!<p>And Jon Agee in his 1991 book Go Hang a Salami – I&#039;m a Lasagna Hog,<br>rephrased it as:<p>A car, a man, a maraca!<p>More on Palindromes<br>Find out more about palindromes on our What are Palindromes? page.
